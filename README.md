  Create the database by running mysql -u root -p and then enter your password. Next run source db/schema.sql; from the mysql prompt, then exit; After that run node seeds/index.js to seed the database and finally npm start to start the server. Once the server is started use an API client, such as Insomnia or Postman to mock the front end.
